## My process

- Normally when building websites i start with Mobile first, then i build towards the Desktop version. But in this challenge i designed for Laptop screen first before proceeding to Tablet and Mobile.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid System

### What I learned

I used my knowledge on CSS Grid system to solve this challenge, now i understand how the CSS Grid system works. I also learnt how to combine selectors, which I'm very proud of.

I'm really proud of myself for coming up with this selector i combined  without the help of Google or Stackoverflow.

```css
.white div .name-title h3 {
  color: hsl(217, 19%, 35%);
}
```

### Continued development

Looking forward to solving more complex Grid problems with CSS Grid system

### Useful resources
